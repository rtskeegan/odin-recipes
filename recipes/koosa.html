    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This is an easy, quick weeknight meal using zucchini, steak, rice, and tomatoes. Explore new flavors use up that fresh summer-time zucchini!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 large zucchini (optionally replace half of the zucchini with yellow squash for a colorful meal!)</li>
        <li>1 pound chopped top round steak</li>
        <li>1 cup white rice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can tomato soup</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut one end off each zucchini. Use a small scoop to scoop the flesh from the zucchinis, leaving shells. Discard the flesh.</li>
        <li>Mix chopped round steak, rice, nutmeg, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Lightly stuff the steak mixture into the zucchinis, making sure to leave about 1 inch of space for the rice to expand; if you don't, the zucchini will burst which still tastes good but doesn't look as nice.</li>
        <li>Place the zucchinis in a large pot; add tomato soup and stewed tomatoes. Place a plate on top of the zucchinis to prevent them from bouncing around once the sauce is boiling.</li>
        <li>Bring the sauce to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until the rice is fully cooked, 30 to 45 minutes.</li>

    </ol>
